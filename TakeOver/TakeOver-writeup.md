## 1. Innitial Environment Setup

At first I mapped the target IP addres to the domain futurevera.thm within my /etc/hosts
<pre>
┌──(exequze㉿kalimach)-[~]
└─$ sudo bash -c 'echo "10.80.182.83    futurevera.thm" >> /etc/hosts'  
</pre>

Alternatively you can do sudo -s and then just the echo command.

## 2. Connectivity Check

I started with a simple ping to confirm the host was alive, followed by a standard Nmap scan

<pre>
┌──(exequze㉿kalimach)-[~]
└─$ ping 10.80.182.83

</pre>
33,3% packet loss, because I am too impatient and hit Ctrl + C.

<pre>

80/tcp  open  http
443/tcp open  https

</pre>
As we can see, Ports 22, 80 and 443 are open.

## 3. Web Exploration & Rabbit-Hole

I initially explored the main website and dove deep into the source code. I'll admit - I got pretty lost there. After realizing the source code wasn't giving up any secrets, I remembered the description of the task "This challenge revolves around subdomain enumeration." So well I did that.

## 4. Fuzzing for Subdomains 

I used ffuf to look for virtual hosts (At this point I looked at a writeup to see how to properly do subdomain enumeration). My first pass was over HTTP:
<pre>
┌──(exequze㉿kalimach)-[~]
└─$ ffuf -u http://10.80.182.83 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-words.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.futurevera.thm" -fs 0

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\

          \/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/       

       v2.1.0-dev

</pre>

Results: Found portal and payroll, but after a quick look, they didn't seem to lead anywhere interesting.

Since port 443 was open, I ran ffuf again, this time targeting HTTPS.

</pre>
This result is from the second time running, because I filtered out the default response size only on the second one. 

## 5. SSL Certificate Inspection 

After adding blog.futurevera.thm and support.futurevera.thm to /etc/hosts, the blog turned out to be another dead end. However, I decided to check the SSL for the support site. There I found:
<pre>
Subject Alt Names
DNS Name	secretxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.support.futurevera.thm
</pre>

## 6. Capturing the flag

I added this long subdomain to my /etc/hosts file and navigated to it via Web. The server immediately redirected me to an external AWS S3 bucktet URL.
<pre>
https://flag{********************************}.s3-website-us-west-3.amazonaws.com/
</pre>

## 7. ConclusionEnvironment

This was my first CTF and it was very interesting, took longer then expected but helped me a lot.
