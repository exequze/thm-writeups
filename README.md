## Writeups

Welcome! This repository is a collection of my walkthroughs, notes, and solutions for various TryHackMe, Hackthebox or PicoCTF Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges.

Each writeup is designed to document my methodology—from initial reconnaissance and enumeration to privilege escalation and final exploitation. My goal is to maintain a clear record of my learning progress and provide a helpful resource for others in the cybersecurity community.
